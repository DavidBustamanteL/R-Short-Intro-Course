## So, why learn R?

![](R vs Excel_Same Data, Different Vibes.png){height=300px fig-align="center"}

- R is a free and powerful programming language designed for data analysis, statistics, and visualization.  
  It’s widely used in research, academia, and many professional fields — from economics and psychology to  
  biology and the social sciences.  

- Once you get familiar with it, you’ll see how much it can simplify your data work and help you later when  
  learning other languages, such as Python. Mastering tools like R also opens up many future job opportunities  
  in data-driven fields.

- Why learning to code in times of AI? Even if those models are so powerfull, being able to "speak" their  
  language will give you quite the competitive advantage over "vibe-coders", who never really understand  
  the output and put their blind-faith into the AI.

## Installation

I would kindly ask you to download R and Positron on your computers.

### R
The latest version of R can be found at:  
https://cran.r-project.org/  

### Positron
Please follow this link:  
https://positron.posit.co/download.html  

If you're using your private laptops, I would recommend the **"Setup.exe"** file.

## Optional: Install Packages in Advance

If you wish, you can already install the packages yourself by running the following code:

```r
# List of packages
package_list = c(
  "tidyverse", "dplyr", "stringr", "forcats", "magrittr", "lubridate", "reshape2",
  "readxl", "readr", "haven", "jsonlite", "rjson", "eurostat", "gapminder",
  "ggplot2", "ggthemes", "ggrepel", "ggpubr", "ggpp", "ggtext", "GGally",
  "viridis", "RColorBrewer",
  "giscoR", "sf", "maps", "mapproj", "rnaturalearth",
  "modelsummary", "rstatix", "gtsummary", "stargazer"
)

# Installation
for(i in package_list){
  if(!require(i, character.only = TRUE)){
    install.packages(i, dependencies = TRUE)
    require(i, character.only = TRUE)
  }
}

```
